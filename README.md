# AirBnB_clone
A repository for the airbnb console project.

# Authors
This is a group project done by Andrew Ssentongo and Victoria Unanam.

# Project Description:
This is a project on making the AirBnB clone console. The project forms the basis of the coming projects for building a fully functioning AirBNB clone website. The project aims at making a command interpreter that will be a management tool for handling objects within the project.

#Command Interpreter Description. #Decription: The command interpreter refers to a program that enables the user to interact with the system by providing an interface where commands are entered, read, interpreted and executed.

#How to start the command Interpreter.

Enter the repository containing the command interpreter.
Enter the directory having the file of the command interpreter.
Using "./console.py" command runs the command interpreter's script.
The showing of the command prompt (hbnb) indicates that the command interpreter can now accept commands.
#How to use the command interpreter. -While the command interpreter is still accepting commands, the user can enter commands to manage the objects within the AirBnB project. These commands include: create, show, destroy, all, and update.

Examples
#To create a new user. (hbnb) create user

#To update the name of the Visitor. (hbnb) update Visitor "John" name "Joseph"
