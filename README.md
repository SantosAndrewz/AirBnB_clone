# AirBnB_clone
a repository for the airbnb console project

#
This is a group project done by Andrew Ssentongo and Victoria Unanam. 

#Project Description.
This is a project on making the AirBnB clone console. The project forms the basis of the coming projects for building a fully functioning AirBNB clone website.
The project aims at making a command interpreter that will be a management tool for handling objects within the project. 

#Command Interpreter Description.
#Decription:
The command interpreter refers to a program that enables the user to interact with the system by providing an interface where commands are entered, read, interpreted and executed.

#How to start the command Interpreter.
- Enter the repository containing the command interpreter.
- Enter the directory having the file of the command interpreter.
- Using "./console.py" command runs the command interpreter's script.
- The showing of the command prompt (hbnb) indicates that the command interpreter can now accept commands.

#How to use the command interpreter.
-While the command interpreter is still accepting commands, the user can enter commnands to manage the ojects within the AirBnB project. These commands include: create, show, destroy, all, update.

# Examples

#To create a new user.
(hbnb) create user

#To update the name of the Visitor.
(hbnb) update Visitor "John" name "Joseph"
